## About : 

       A CSS Reset (or “Reset CSS”) is a short, set of CSS rules that resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline.
      In case you didn't know, every browser has its own default 'user agent' stylesheet, that it uses to make unstyled websites appear more legible.

      Using a CSS Reset, CSS authors can force every browser to have all its styles reset to null, thus avoiding cross-browser differences as much as possible.
